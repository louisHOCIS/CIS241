<p>
I have learned a lot from the EdCC CIS 241 class. Before starting this class, my HTML knowledge was limited to paragraph, bold, italic, and line break tags. This class has taught me how to build a basic website using HTML5 and CSS.
</p>
<p>
I’ve had trouble with online classes before, and this one was no exception. I thrive on being able to ask questions as soon as I have them in a classroom lecture setting, so lacking this ability in an online class always impacts my learning. However, I have improved my ability to use search engines to find the information I need. This has improved my problem-solving skills in writing code.
</p>
<p>
One of the difficulties I had with this class was knowing when to follow along exactly with the CIW learning materials and when to focus on building my own site. Using the SYB files in the CIW lessons became taxing and confusing, so it was often helpful to avoid using the SYB files and instead apply the CIW lessons to my own site. Because of this, I fully appreciate the class’ emphasis on the final competency exam instead of the assignments throughout the class. This flexibility fit my learning style very well.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:20px;">
I am definitely excited to learn more about web development after this class. Throughout the class I have been viewing the code of other websites to see how their designs work. I have noticed that many websites make JavaScript central to their design. I am excited to learn JavaScript and how it can be integrated into my websites to make them more professional and aesthetically appealing.
